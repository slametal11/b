            The Delaware is an American breed of chicken with an unusual plumage pattern. It was developed in the state of Delaware in the mid-twentieth century, and was initially known as the Indian River. It was briefly of some importance in the American chicken industry, until it was superseded by the common industrial Cornish Rock cross. <br/><br/>In the twenty-first century it is an endangered breed. It may be kept for meat, for eggs or for showing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In the early twentieth century, the cross of a Barred Plymouth Rock rooster on a New Hampshire hen was a common choice for producing broilers. Occasionally, this mating produces sports with light coloration. George Ellis of Delaware selectively bred these light-colored birds, which led to the creation of the breed in 1940. He first chose to call them Indian Rivers, but later the name was switched to match its state of origin. At the time, the Delmarva Peninsula, where the breed was created, supplied chicken to the entirety of the East Coast of the United States through companies such as Perdue Farms.: 84  The Delaware rapidly became the principal broiler fowl in use in the region, thus affecting the industry at large.: 59  It was added to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1952; the bantam version was added in 1960.: 84 <br/><br/>Beginning in the mid-1950s, commercial farms began to use the White Cornish-Rock cross that would come to dominate the chicken industry into the next century.
