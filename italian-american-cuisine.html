            Italian-American cuisine (Italian: cucina italoamericana) is a style of Italian cuisine adapted throughout the United States. Italian-American food has been shaped throughout history by various waves of immigrants and their descendants, called Italian Americans.<br/><br/>As immigrants from the different regions of Italy settled throughout the various regions of the United States, many brought with them a distinct regional Italian culinary tradition. Many of these foods and recipes developed into new favorites for the townspeople and later for Americans nationwide.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Influences ==<br/><br/>Italian-American food is based primarily on the culinary traditions of southern Italian immigrants, although a significant number of northern Italian immigrants also came to the United States and also influenced this style of cuisine to some extent.<br/><br/>Italian-Americans often identify foods with their regional heritage. Southern Italian staples include dry pasta, tomato sauce, and olive oil, whereas northern Italian staples include foods such as risotto, white sauce, and polenta.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Migration ===<br/><br/>In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Italian poor suffered from severe food insecurity, from taxes, modernization (depriving them of feudal land access), and overpopulation. The non-landowning class survived on a mostly vegetarian diet consisting of hard bread and soups;: 22  meat, if any, was reserved for celebration. Partial knowledge of fine food trickled down from the rich from restaurants, despite the poor having little means to access them.: 41 <br/><br/>Under this background, waves of Italians immigrated to the United States, mainly through Ellis Island.
