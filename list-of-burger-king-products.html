            When the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, Burger King began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it was not until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.<br/><br/>The company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. Burger King's Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s.
