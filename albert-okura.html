            Albert Okura (December 3, 1951 – January 27, 2023) was an American businessman who was the founder and CEO of the Juan Pollo restaurant chain in Southern California. He was also a philanthropist and was active in the revitalization of Historic Route 66. In 2005, Okura purchased the town of Amboy, California, which is located along Route 66. The corporate headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain now sits on the original location of the first McDonald's restaurant where Okura created and hosted a museum, preserving artifacts and memorabilia about the landmark.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Okura, a third-generation (or sansei) Japanese American, was born in 1951 in the Wilmington section of Los Angeles. His first full-time job was with Burger King in 1970, which led to managerial positions in the chain as well as Del Taco, and ultimately founding his own Mexican-influenced chicken rotisserie chain.<br/><br/>In 1981, while working for Del Taco in Carson, an El Pollo Loco opened near him. At the time El Pollo Loco was a new char-broiled Mexican chicken chain. Okura tried the restaurant and was impressed with the food and the simplicity of its operations and began to investigate opening his own restaurant.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Juan Pollo ==<br/><br/>Okura's uncle initially invested in his idea to open a restaurant and made Okura aware of a restaurant location in a shopping mall he owned in Ontario, California.
