            Bomb Chicken is a 2D puzzle-platform game developed and published by Nitrome. The game was first released in the Americas and Europe on July 12, 2018, for the Nintendo Switch game console through the Nintendo eShop download service, followed by versions for macOS and Microsoft Windows in April 2019 and one for PlayStation 4 in April 2019. Ports for Android and iOS were released in April 2020.<br/><br/>Set in a Latin American jungle, the player controls a chicken who can lay multiple bombs, which are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in order to escape a processing plant run by BFC, a large fast-food chain. Bomb Chicken was well received by critics, who praised its gameplay and presentation, but criticized its short length.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Gameplay ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bomb Chicken is a 2D puzzle-platformer where the player controls a chicken who can lay bombs instead of eggs. The chicken obtained this power after an accident involving the mysterious blue sauce that is being mined by BFC (parody to KFC), a large fast-food chain. Unlike in most platformers, the chicken cannot jump; instead, it ascends by laying bombs which it stands on top of. The chicken can lay multiple bombs in a stack in order to reach higher places. The bombs automatically explode a few seconds after laying them, so the chicken must move quickly after laying them.
