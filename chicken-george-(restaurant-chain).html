            Chicken George was a fast food restaurant chain based in Baltimore, Maryland. The first restaurant was established by Theodore Holmes in November 1979 in the Mondawmin Mall in Baltimore. The company later expanded to a total of six restaurants in Baltimore, and also branched out to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. Franchise restaurants were also existent in Atlanta, Los Angeles and in other cities. In September 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy to be dissolved.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Company overview ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Beginnings ===<br/><br/>The restaurants were owned by Joloj Industries, Inc., which was founded by Theodore Holmes. The company's name was chosen based upon a character name in the book Roots: The Saga of an American Family. At its prime, the company had six restaurants in Baltimore, two in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and a location in Washington D.C., along with franchise restaurants. The chain was very popular in Baltimore, having been described as "that it seemingly became a household name overnight" by the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper. In August, 1980 the company was described by the Baltimore Afro-American as "the highest grossing single chicken outlet in the country" (per the advisement of Theodore Holmes to the newspaper). In 1982 the company earned sales revenue of US$14 million.
