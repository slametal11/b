            Boiled eggs are typically from a chicken, and are cooked with their shells unbroken, usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled or hard-cooked eggs are cooked so that the egg white and egg yolk both solidify, while soft-boiled eggs may leave the yolk, and sometimes the white, at least partially liquid and raw. Boiled eggs are a popular breakfast food around the world.<br/><br/>Besides a boiling water immersion, there are a few different methods to make boiled eggs. Eggs can also be cooked below the boiling temperature, i.e. coddling, or they can be steamed. The egg timer was named for commonly being used to time the boiling of eggs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Eggs have a long history of use as a food source, following the history of the domestic Chicken, and recipes that include boiled eggs have been recorded since the first known cookbook, De re coquinaria, in which at least one recipe calls for the use of preserved boiled eggs. Alexander Pope is recorded as having recommended the method of cooking eggs over the embers or ashes of an open fire.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Scientific background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The process of cooking an egg causes the proteins within the yolk and albumin to denature and solidify, resulting in a solid egg white and yolk.
