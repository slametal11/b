            The Chantecler is a Canadian breed of dual-purpose chicken, reared for both egg and meat production. It was bred in the early twentieth century at the Oka Agricultural Institute in Oka, Quebec, and is the only chicken breed originating in Canada.: 418  It is characterised by close-fitting feathering, a small or vestigial cushion-shaped comb and small or vestigial wattles, all of which make it more resistant than many other breeds to the extreme cold of the Canadian winter.<br/><br/>It is an endangered breed, and its conservation status is listed in DAD-IS as "at risk/endangered". It is thought that there are some 1000 of the birds in the province of Québec, with small numbers elsewhere in Canada.: 3 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>At the dawn of the 20th century, no breeds of chicken had been established in Canada, and Canadian farmers and poultry fanciers only had fowl of European and American derivation. This fact was noted by Brother Wilfrid Châtelain, a Trappist monk and Doctor of Agronomy, as he toured the poultry flocks of the Oka Agricultural Institute, an agricultural school at his abbey which is affiliated with the Université de Montréal. <br/><br/>In 1907, the Brother set out to remedy this void and create a practical chicken that would be suited to Canada's climate and production needs. Working at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Oka, Chantelain first combined Dark Cornishes, White Leghorns, Rhode Island Reds, White Plymouth Rocks and White Wyandottes, creating the White variant of the Chantecler. It was admitted into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1921.: 51   By 1918, the breed was presented to the public. To this day, the Chantecler is one of only two breeds of poultry from Canada, and the only one known to have been created primarily by a member of a monastic order.: 59  <br/><br/>At the outset, it was only intended for the breed to be white in color; white birds are preferred for commercial meat production in the West, as they produce a particularly clean-looking carcass. In the 1930s, the Partridge Chantecler was generated by crossing Partridge Wyandottes, Partridge Cochins, Dark Cornishes, and the rose comb type of Brown Leghorns to produce a chicken more adapted to free range conditions.
