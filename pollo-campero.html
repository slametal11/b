            Pollo Campero is a Guatemalan fast-food restaurant chain, located in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Mexico, Spain, Bahrain, the United States, Belize, Haiti, Anguilla, Montserrat, the British Virgin Islands, Brazil, Czech Republic, Slovakia,  the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy. The chain has nearly 400 locations, including more than 100 in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Corporate affairs and history ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pollo Campero International headquarters are located in Dallas, Texas. The current facility is in 12,633 square feet (1,173.6 m2) of area in the Hidden Grove office building in North Dallas. The headquarters was previously in a 6,800-square-foot (630 m2) area in Lincoln Center, but moved in 2016.<br/><br/>Pollo Campero has been popular with the Guatemalan and Salvadoran diaspora, who see it as a nostalgic taste from home. This led to a tradition of relatives bringing boxes of the restaurant's chicken to the United States on international flights, with some even reselling the chicken. Issues with the smell led to the company developing an insulated bag to make it easier to transport for air passengers and better contain odors. While the chain opened branches in the United States starting in 2002, which became quite popular and had eight-hour lines upon opening, many customers felt that the chicken and taste was not the same, and chicken continues to be brought by passengers to the United States. The chain also announced plans to expand to Spain, Poland and Portugal in that year.
