            The cuisine of New York City comprises many cuisines belonging to various ethnic groups that have entered the United States through the city. Almost all ethnic cuisines are well represented in New York, both within and outside the various ethnic neighborhoods.<br/><br/>The city's New York Restaurant Week started in 1992 and has spread around the world due to the discounted prices that such a deal offers. In New York there are over 12,000 bodegas, delis, and groceries, and many among them are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Food identified with New York ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Food associated with or popularized in New York ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hot dogs – served with sauerkraut, sweet relish, onion sauce, or mustard.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine ====<br/><br/><br/><br/>A good portion of the cuisine usually associated with New York stems in part from its large community of Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants.<br/><br/>The world-famous New York institution of the delicatessen, commonly referred to as a "deli," was originally an institution of the city's Jewry. Much of New York's Jewish fare, predominantly based on Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, has become popular around the globe, especially bagels. (New York City's Jewish community is also famously fond of Chinese food, and many members of this community think of it as their second ethnic cuisine.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Italian-American cuisine ====<br/><br/>A large part of the cuisine associated with New York stems from its large community of Italian-Americans and their descendants. Much of New York's Italian fare has become popular around the globe, especially New York-style pizza.
