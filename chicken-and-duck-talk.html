<h1>Chicken and Duck Talk</h1>
            
            Chicken and Duck Talk (Chinese: 雞同鴨講; Jyutping: gai1 tung4 aap3 gong2; lit. 'Chicken with Duck Talk') is a 1988 comedy film starring and co-written by Michael Hui. It is directed and co-written by Clifton Ko. The film deals with the conflict that ensues between the proprietor of an old-fashioned roast duck restaurant that is in trouble for health violations and the new fast food chicken restaurant that opens across the street. The film was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film released in 1988. Hui's screenplay and performance won him several awards, including a special award given by the American Film Institute in 1989.<br/><br/>The film also includes a celebrity cameo by Sam Hui (Michael's younger brother), as the master of ceremonies at the grand opening of Danny's Chicken, and the screen debut of Gloria Yip in a brief appearance as Hui's son's school friend. Sam Hui (as himself) speaks the title phrase, an idiom for people not understanding each other, to cut his speech short.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>Hui (Michael Hui) is the struggling proprietor of a Cantonese BBQ roast duck restaurant in Hong Kong. At the beginning of the film, Hui is visited by a health inspector, who finds a cockroach in his soup and other unsanitary conditions, and threatens to sue the restaurant.
