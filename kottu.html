            Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, commonly known as Kotte (pronounced [ˈkoːʈeː]), is the legislative capital of Sri Lanka. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is located adjacent to the urban area of Sri Lanka's de facto economic, executive, and judicial capital, Colombo.<br/><br/>The Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council area is bounded in:<br/><br/><br/><br/>the North by Kolonnawa Urban Council area,<br/><br/>the North-East by the Kotikawatta–Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha area,<br/><br/>the East by the Kaduwela Municipal Council area,<br/><br/>the South-East by the Maharagama Urban Council area,<br/><br/>the South-West by the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council and<br/><br/>the West by the Colombo Municipal Council area, which is the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The village of Darugama lay at the confluence of two streams, the Diyawanna Oya and the Kolonnawa Oya. As Darugama was a naturally secure place, it was not easy for enemies to enter it. Here, in the 13th century, a local chieftain, Nissanka Alagakkonara, built a Kotte, or fortress.<br/><br/>Alagakkonara is mentioned by Ibn Batuta as ruling in Kurunegala, but other sources indicate that he was the Bandara (Guardian) of Raigama Korale (county) in the modern Kalutara District. Arya Chakravarthy's army was held by Alagakkonara in front of Kotte, while he defeated the enemy's invasion fleet at Panadura to the south-west.<br/><br/>Kotte was a jala durgha (water fortress), in the shape of a triangle, with the Diyawanna Oya and Kolonnawa Oya marshes forming two long sides; along the shorter third (land) side a large moat (the 'inner moat') was dug. The fortress was nearly 2.5 km2 (0.97 sq mi) in area, fortified with ramparts of kabook or laterite rock, 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high and 10.7 metres (35 ft) in breadth.
