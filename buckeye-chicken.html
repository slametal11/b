            The Buckeye is an American breed of chicken. It was created in Ohio in the late nineteenth century by Nettie Metcalf. The color of its plumage was intended to resemble the color of the seeds of Aesculus glabra, the Ohio Buckeye plant for which the state is called the 'Buckeye State'.<br/><br/>It is a dual-purpose chicken, kept for both meat and eggs. It is yellow-skinned, and the eggs are brown. It is the only breed in the American Class to have a pea comb.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Buckeye was first bred and developed in 1896, by Nettie Metcalf, a resident of Warren, Ohio.: 56  It is the only American breed of chicken known to have been developed by a woman, although women customarily were in charge of the household poultry flock on farms and in households throughout much of U.S. history.: 79  Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks, Buff Cochins, and some black-breasted red games to produce the Buckeye. Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters. Contrary to popular belief, the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed. Metcalf sent birds to the RIR breeders in order for them to improve their breed.: 79 <br/><br/>The Buckeye was admitted in 1904 to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection.: 80  This acceptance signifies official certification as a breed by the Association, allowing Buckeyes to be entered into poultry shows and judged according to the breed standard (as outlined in the Standard of Perfection).
