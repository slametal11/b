            The Halal Guys is a halal fast casual restaurant franchise that began as halal carts on the southeast and southwest corners of 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. New locations, both food cart and storefront, are being added throughout New York (including a storefront on 14th Street and Second Avenue) and around the world.<br/><br/>The franchise is most recognized by its primary dish which is a platter of chicken or gyro meat with rice, though it also serves a chicken or gyro wrap sandwich.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Halal Guys was founded in 1990 by Egyptian-Americans Mohamed Abouelenein, Ahmed Elsaka, and Abdelbaset Elsayed as a hot dog cart located at the southeast corner of 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue. Abouelenein, however, believed that a hot dog was not a satisfying meal, and switched to the current menu of chicken, gyro meat, rice, and pita in 1992. As a result, New York City's Muslim cab drivers flocked to the cart for its ability to provide a quick, relatively inexpensive halal meal. As word of mouth spread via these cab drivers, the operators created the signature dish, a platter of chicken and rice which was popularized within the Muslim community in the city.<br/><br/>The cart has caused a decline in the popularity of hot dog vendors in New York City and has influenced many food trucks.<br/><br/>A cart called "New York's Best Halal Food" is also located on the southwest corner of 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue. It is unknown which cart was located at the intersection first.
