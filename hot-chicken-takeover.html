            Hot Chicken Takeover or HCT: Southern Chicken is an American fast casual fried chicken restaurant chain in Columbus, Ohio that specializes in Nashville hot chicken.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Founder Joe DeLoss started the company after visiting Nashville, Tennessee and being introduced to the local specialty hot chicken in 2013. The company was initially founded as a pop-up restaurant in April 2014, before launching a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter later that year to fund the purchase of a food truck.<br/><br/>In 2021, the restaurant chain was acquired by Untamed Brands. Untamed Brands was taken over by Craveworthy Brands in May 2024. <br/><br/>In October 2024, Craveworthy Brands CEO, Gregg Majewski, announced they would be combining their Chicago-based chain The Budlong Southern Chicken, into the Hot Chicken Takeover concept, under the name HCT: Southern Chicken. Columbus-area locations will keep the Hot Chicken Takeover name. Along with the announcement, a new menu was unveiled that included chicken-fried steak, hushpuppies, cornbread and sweet tea.<br/><br/>The company received significant media coverage for its stated mission of being a fair chance employer that provides job opportunities to formerly incarcerated people who are reentering the workforce and other individuals who are not otherwise able to find work. In 2016, over 70% of Hot Chicken Takeover employees were formerly incarcerated or formerly affected by homelessness.
