            Chicken Run is a 2000 animated adventure comedy film produced by Pathé and Aardman Features in partnership with DreamWorks Animation. Aardman's first feature-length film, it was directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park with a screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick from an original story by Lord and Park. The film stars the voices of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Tony Haygarth, Miranda Richardson, Phil Daniels, Lynn Ferguson, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Benjamin Whitrow. Set in the countryside of Yorkshire, the plot centres on a group of British anthropomorphic chickens who see an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes as their only hope to escape the farm when their owners want to turn them into chicken pies.<br/><br/>Chicken Run was released in the United States on 23 June 2000 and in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2000. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $220 million and becoming the highest-grossing stop-motion animated film in history. At the time, this film was DreamWorks Animation's most successful release, but this was overtaken by Shrek the following year.<br/><br/>23 years later, a sequel, titled Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, was released on Netflix on 15 December 2023. Its Netflix release followed its world premiere at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, which would also see preview screenings taking place at UK cinemas at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>In the countryside of Yorkshire, a flock of chickens live on an egg farm structured like a prisoner-of-war camp.
