            Western-style fast food in mainland China is a fairly recent phenomenon, with Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) establishing its first Beijing restaurant in November 1987. This location was met with unprecedented success, and served as a model for many local Chinese restaurants that followed it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The history of western-style fast food in China dates back to 1906, when "Yili's Fast Food Shop" (义利快餐厅) was established in Beijing as the country's very first fast food restaurant in the Far East of the Asia-Pacific region.<br/><br/>Rapid economic development, and the growth of global trade and cultural exchanges have accelerated changes in people's lifestyles in transitional societies like China. Among these changes, the observed shift in people's food consumption from a traditional diet to a Westernized diet is a result of multiple factors, which may contribute to observed increases in obesity and chronic diseases. Over the past two decades, the fast-food (FF) industry and obesity rates have increased rapidly in China. Pizza Hut and McDonald's were launched in China in September and October 1990, respectively. Three years earlier, KFC was established in mainland China. The first McDonald's in Shenzhen was supplied from Hong Kong from 1990 to 1992. By the time the first McDonald's in Beijing opened in 1992, mainland China had proper infrastructure to supply the restaurants.
