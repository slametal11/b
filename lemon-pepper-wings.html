            Lemon pepper wings are unbreaded chicken wings coated in lemon pepper seasoning. The dish was invented in Atlanta, Georgia, and is considered to be emblematic of the cuisine of Atlanta.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Lemon pepper wings were invented in Atlanta, Georgia, where people began adding lemon pepper to buffalo wings to reduce their spiciness. The popularity of lemon pepper wings in the mid-2000s has been attributed to their being less likely to dirty clothes than buffalo wings, making them preferred by rappers who commonly wore white t-shirts at the time.<br/><br/>The dish is strongly associated with Atlanta cuisine. Future Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms commented that "Lemon pepper wings are Atlanta" in 2017. In 2022, Eric Kim of The New York Times wrote that "in Atlanta, lemon pepper is queen" and described the wings as "central to [the city's] social fabric."<br/><br/>The wings have inspired various items such as lemon pepper tacos, loaded fries, pierogies, pizza, beer, and soda.<br/><br/>Lemon pepper wings are frequently served in the city's strip clubs. Chris Kirschner of The Athletic observed that high-quality food was often a hallmark of Atlanta strip clubs, particularly wings, and their food was known to draw celebrity guests. The dish is also served throughout the United States by chain restaurants.
