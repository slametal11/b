            Churrasco (Portuguese: [ʃuˈʁasku], Spanish: [tʃuˈrasko]) is the Portuguese and Spanish name for grilled beef prominent in South American and Iberian cuisines, and in particular in Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay,  and Argentina. The term is also used in other Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries for a variety of different meat products.<br/><br/>The related Brazilian term churrascaria (or churrasquería) is mostly understood to be a steakhouse restaurant serving grilled meat, many offering as much as one can eat: servers move around the restaurant with skewers, slicing meat onto the customer's plate. This serving style is called espeto corrido or rodízio, and is quite popular in Brazil, especially in southern states like Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, and Santa Catarina.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Churrasco by country ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Brazil, churrasco is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine and Uruguayan asado) which originated in southern Brazil. It uses a variety of meats, pork, sausage and chicken which may be cooked on a purpose-built churrasqueira, a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. A home equipped with a churrasqueira is a main selling point for properties in Southern Brazil. Portable churrasqueiras are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine and Uruguayan asado, with a grill support, but many Brazilian churrasqueiras do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul).<br/><br/>In Nicaragua, the first immigrant group to introduce the term for this cut of beef to the United States restaurant scene in Miami, Florida as early as the 1950s, it refers to a skirt steak prepared grilled and served with a traditional chimichurri sauce made with macerated parsley, garlic, peppers, and olive oil sauce.
