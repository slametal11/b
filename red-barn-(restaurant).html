            The Red Barn restaurant was a fast-food restaurant chain founded in 1961 in Springfield, Ohio, by Don Six, Martin Levine, and Jim Kirst. In 1963, the small chain was purchased by Richard O. Kearns, operated as Red Barn System, with the offices moving briefly to Dayton, Ohio and in August 1964 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the late 1960s United Servomation, also called Servomation, bought the Red Barn chain.<br/><br/>In 1978, United Servomation merged with the City Investing Company's GDV division which also owned the Motel 6 motel chain. Only interested in real estate, construction, and financial services, the new owners ceased advertising for the chain and allowed the franchise leases to expire. The last one expired in around 1988, leading to the company's permanent closure of all restaurants.  At its peak, Red Barn had 300–400 restaurants in 19 states, as well as outlets in southern Ontario, elsewhere in Canada, and in Australia.<br/><br/>Following the shutdown of operations, most of the Red Barn buildings were converted to other uses. A few of the restaurants were renamed "The Farm" in various states, and continued using the same menu as when they were under their Red Barn franchise. Two locations under "The Farm" name were in Racine, Wisconsin and Bradford, Pennsylvania.
