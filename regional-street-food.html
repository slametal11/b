            Regional street food is street food that has commonalities within a region or culture.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/>Street foods—ready-to-eat food or drink sold in a street or other public place, such as a market or fair, by a hawker or vendor, often from a portable stall— have variations within both regions and cultures. For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being "fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste... and fish sauce" with New York City's signature street food being the hot dog, although the offerings in New York also range from "spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles." In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of "Plate Lunch" (rice, macaroni salad and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Regional trends ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Africa ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Madagascar ====<br/><br/><br/><br/>A variety of cakes and fritters collectively known as mofo are available from kiosks in towns and cities across Madagascar. The most common is mofo gasy, "Malagasy bread",  made from a batter of sweetened rice flour poured into greased circular molds and cooked over charcoal. Mofo gasy is a breakfast food and is often eaten with coffee, also sold at kiosks. In coastal areas this mofo is made with coconut milk and is known as mokary. Other sweet mofo include a deep-fried doughnut called menakely and a fried dough ball called mofo baolina, as well as a variety of fruit fritters, with pineapple and bananas among the most common fruits used. Savory mofo include ramanonaka, a mofo gasy salted and fried in lard, and a fritter flavored with chopped greens, onions, tomatoes, and chilies called mofo sakay, "spicy bread."<br/><br/>In marketplaces and gas stations one may find vendors selling koba akondro, a sweet made by wrapping a batter of ground peanuts, mashed bananas, honey, and corn flour in banana leaves and steaming or boiling the small cakes until the batter has set.
