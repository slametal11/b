            A barbecue restaurant is a restaurant that specializes in barbecue-style cuisine and dishes. Barbecue restaurants may open relatively early compared to other restaurants, in part to optimize sales while barbecued foods being slow-cooked by the process of smoking are being tended to by restaurant personnel on premises. In some instances, this can enable the sales of barbecued meats that began being smoked the night before the next business day. Per these logistics, a significant portion of their sales may occur during lunchtime. Additionally, high lunch turnover at barbecue restaurants may occur per the foods being cooked and sold in large batches. Popular food items may sell out earlier compared to others, which may encourage customers to arrive earlier. In January 2015, the U.S. National Restaurant Association forecast "barbecue, Italian food and fried chicken" to be "top perennial menu favorites in 2015".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== United States ===<br/><br/>In northern and midwestern areas of the United States, a barbecue restaurant may be referred to as a "barbecue joint". In southern areas of the U.S., a barbecue restaurant may be referred to as a "barbecue" or "barbecue place", rather than as a barbecue restaurant. Some barbecue restaurants may be referred to as "shrines" or as a "barbecue shrine", which can refer to those that have earned a strong reputation for purveying high-quality food over the course of several years, and even over the course of generations.
