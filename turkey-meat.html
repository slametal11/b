            Turkey meat, commonly referred to simply as turkey, is the meat from turkeys, typically domesticated turkeys, but also wild turkeys. It is a popular poultry dish, especially in North America and the United Kingdom, where it is traditionally consumed as part of culturally significant events such as Thanksgiving and Christmas as well as in standard cuisine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Preparation and production ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Turkeys are sold sliced and ground, as well as whole in a manner similar to  chicken with the head, feet, and feathers removed. Turkey crowns are the breast of the bird with its legs and wings removed. Frozen whole turkeys remain popular. Sliced turkey is frequently used as a sandwich meat or served as cold cuts; in some cases where recipes call for chicken, it can be used as a substitute. Ground turkey is sold and frequently marketed as a healthy alternative to ground beef. Without careful preparation, cooked turkey is usually considered to end up less moist than other poultry meats such as chicken or duck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wild turkeys, while technically the same species as domesticated turkeys, have a very different taste from farm-raised turkeys. Almost all of the meat is dark (including the breast) with a more intense flavor.
