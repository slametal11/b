            American Chinese cuisine, also known as Sino–American cuisine is a cuisine developed by Chinese Americans based on the wide variety of Chinese food. Most of the dishes served in many North American Chinese restaurants are modified to suit American peoples' tastes and are often quite different from Chinese cuisine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The history of American Chinese cuisine can be traced back to the California Gold Rush (1848-1855). Chinese immigrants came to the United States in search for work as gold miners and railroad workers. As more Chinese immigrants arrived, the United States introduced laws that prohibited them from owning land. Chinese immigrants, started small businesses on the west coast, including restaurants and laundry services. Early American Chinese food tended to be homogenized, requiring adaptation of local ingredients and catering to Americanized tastes. By the 19th century, Chinese Americans in San Francisco operated luxurious restaurants patronized mainly by Chinese customers, serving food based customers requests, including anything from pork chop sandwiches and apple pie to beans and eggs. Many of these restaurant owners were self-taught family cooks who improvised with different cooking methods using whatever ingredients were available.<br/><br/>These smaller restaurants were responsible for the development of American Chinese food, adapting it to suit the tastes of Americans.
