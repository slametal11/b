            Urban keeping of chickens as pets, for eggs,  meat, or for eating pests is popular in urban and suburban areas. Some people sell the eggs for side income.<br/><br/>Keeping chickens in an urban environment is a type of urban agriculture, important in the local food movement, which is the growing  practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in or around a village, town or city.  According to National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service and experts in backyard agriculture, there are a host of personal benefits associated with urban agriculture and keeping chickens in one's own backyard.<br/><br/>Additionally, there is a growing number of people (including in urban environments) who are adopting ex-commercial hens – interrupting their usual destination of the slaughterhouse when the egg farming industry no longer wants them (typically at around the age of 1.5 years).<br/><br/>Those caring for chickens as pets may not have the expectation of eggs; some may even feed their hens' eggs back to them or even hormonally implant their hens to prevent egg-laying, which is purported to offer welfare benefits for the hens. Those caring for chickens as pets may also have experience caring for disabled chickens and/or indoor chickens.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Keeping livestock in cities has been common throughout history and is still practiced in many parts of the world. For example, 50,000 pigs were being kept in Manhattan in 1859. But local ordinances were created to limit this, owing to the noise and smell nuisance, and these were relaxed only in times of war when the urban populace was encouraged to provide food for itself.
