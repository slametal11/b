            Breaded cutlet or braised cutlet is a dish made from coating a cutlet of meat with breading or batter and either frying or baking it.<br/><br/>Breaded cutlet is known as schnitzel in German-speaking countries, cotoletta in Italy, escalope in France, filete empanado or cachopo in Spain, filete empanizado in Cuba, milanesa in Latin America, katsu in Japan and Korea, kotlet in Poland, řízek in the Czech Republic, rezeň in Slovakia and kotleta in post-Soviet countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Chicken fingers ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chicken fingers or chicken tenders are an American dish prepared by breading and deep frying the pectoralis minor muscle of the chicken, which is the smaller cut of the chicken breast located along its underside, attached to the ribs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Chicken-fried steak ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chicken-fried steak (also known as country-fried steak) is an American breaded cutlet dish that may have originated with German and Austrian immigrants to Texas in the 19th century. It is a piece of beef steak (tenderized cubed steak) coated with seasoned flour and fried. It is associated with Southern U.S. cuisine.
