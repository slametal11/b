            Filipino American cuisine has been present in America ever since Filipinos moved there, but only recently has the Filipino food become more widely popular. Filipino food has gone through its evolution of adapting other cultures' food practices into their own, or borrowing the food concept into their own.<br/><br/>Filipinos took their food and debut it as they came to America by presenting it in catering and opening up the Philippines' most popular food chain, Jollibee. There is also a long list of different Filipino types of dishes that represent Filipino Americans.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== American influence ==<br/><br/>American influence on Filipino food is how some authentic meal was turned into frozen, ready-cooked meals. This technique was used on Filipino dishes when Marigold Commodities Corporation teamed up with Ditta Meat Food Service Company to create these frozen Filipino meals. They started in Austin, Texas, and released a few dishes that would incorporate the meat of America with Philippine flavors to create Filipino American food.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Types of food ===<br/><br/>There were four of these Americanized Filipino dishes released into Texas under the work of Marigold Commodities and Ditta Meat Food Service. Beef tapa uses Texas meat marinated with garlic, citrus flavors, and soy sauce, then grilled or fried. The other dishes are tocino using chicken and pork meat, and pork longaniza.
