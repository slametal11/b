            Festival or Jamaican festival is a type of deep-fried bread, typical of Jamaican cuisine, Despite its slightly sweet taste, it is served as a side dish with escovitch fish, seafood or jerk chicken, as well as, a breakfast item and street food.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>Jamaican festival is a Creole dish which originated in Jamaica. While its exact roots are unclear, it is likely to have been created during the colonial era, from a fusion of ingredients and techniques from the different ethnic groups which have inhabited the island.<br/><br/>The dish bears similarities to hushpuppy which has Native American and French influences, as well as, croquettes de maïs (corn croquettes) from France, Spanish / Latin corn fritters which also have Native American roots,  sorullos from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and Chinese fried doughs which were introduced to the island by Chinese indentured labourers– like Jamaican twist donuts.<br/><br/>Festival has been commonly consumed at Jamaican festivals and celebrations, particularly during Easter. It gained popularity in the 1970s, especially in the Hellshire Beach area, known for seafood.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Preparation ==<br/><br/>The dough is made with wheat flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, milk powder / milk or evaporated milk, butter, sugar and water, which is then fried in vegetable cooking oil until golden brown, and served hot. The finished festival should be crispy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside.<br/><br/>Traditionally, festival is served as a side dish with savory meals such as fried fish, escovitch fish, seafood dishes, jerk pork or jerk chicken.<br/><br/>Its slightly sweet flavor complements the spicy and tangy profiles of these dishes, making it a staple in Jamaican cuisine.
