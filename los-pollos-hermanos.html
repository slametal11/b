            Los Pollos Hermanos (Spanish pronunciation: [los ˈpo.ʝos eɾ.ˈma.nos]; or Spanish pronunciation: [los ˈpo.ʎos eɾ.ˈma.nos] (non-yeísta), English: The Chicken Brothers) is a fictional fast food restaurant chain specializing in chicken that was featured in the television series Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul. In the fictional universe of Breaking Bad, Los Pollos Hermanos is featured as a front organization  for Gus Fring's methamphetamine manufacturing and distribution operation, but is also highly regarded by the general public of the Southwest as a regional chain on par with KFC. The set used for the restaurant's Albuquerque location in the show was at a Twisters branch in South Valley, New Mexico, and Twisters has seen an increase in business attributed to being associated with Breaking Bad. Due to the show's popularity, Los Pollos Hermanos has appeared on numerous occasions as a real-life pop-up restaurant. The real life restaurant serves the same menu items as in the show.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== In-universe history ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Los Pollos Hermanos was founded by Chilean nationals and business partners Gus Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito) and Max Arciniega (James Martinez) in Mexico. An apocryphal story as told in a fictional television commercial suggests that it was inspired by recipes cooked by Gus' uncles. Eventually, Gus emigrated to the United States and opened branches primarily in New Mexico, and the chain grew to have 14 locations throughout the American Southwest. Los Pollos Hermanos trucks were used to smuggle drugs manufactured by the show's fictional drug cartel across the Mexico–United States border. A large chicken farm for Los Pollos Hermanos at the outskirts of Albuquerque served as a front where the incoming meth was processed and shipped to the various stores and other destinations. Fring kept the restaurants themselves clean of any business related to drugs.
