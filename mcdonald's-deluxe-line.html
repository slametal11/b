            The McDonald's Deluxe line was a series of sandwiches introduced in the early to mid 1990s and marketed by McDonald's with the intent of capturing the adult fast food consumer market, presented as a more sophisticated burger for adult tastes. The sandwiches sold poorly and the entire line was discontinued on August 18, 2000. The  Deluxe series was a marketing disaster and is now considered to be one of the most expensive flops in McDonald's history.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The line was first introduced in 1991 with the McLean Deluxe; the Arch Deluxe was introduced in May 1996 and the others on September 27, 1996. Except for the McLean Deluxe, all sandwiches were developed by McDonald's executive chef Andrew Selvaggio.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Advertising ===<br/><br/>McDonald's budgeted at $100–150 million (USD) for the introduction of the line and contracted the Minneapolis-based ad firm of Fallon McElligott to oversee the roll out of the project. The original advertising for these products took the form of children criticizing the new adult oriented sandwiches and Ronald McDonald doing more adult themed things, such as going dancing at a nightclub or playing golf. The firm went so far as to commission the Columbus, Ohio-based Fahlgren ad firm to create a complete set of music designed specifically for the radio ad campaigns. The new tunes were designed to appeal to an 18- to 34-year-old demographic. Further ads were created by DDB Worldwide.
