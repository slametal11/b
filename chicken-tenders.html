            Chicken tenders (also known as chicken goujons, tendies, chicken strips, chicken fingers, or chicken fillets) are chicken meat prepared from the pectoralis minor muscles of the bird. These strips of white meat are located on either side of the breastbone, under the breast meat (pectoralis major). They may also be made with similarly shaped pieces cut from chicken meat, usually the breast, or sometimes just pulverized chicken flesh.<br/><br/>Chicken tenders are prepared by coating chicken meat in a breading mixture and then deep frying them, in a manner similar to the preparation of schnitzel. They are a very popular snack or main course due to their convenience and have become a staple across the United States. Chicken tenders are a popular fast-food snack in the U.S. Some of the most popular fast-food restaurants that sell chicken tenders include Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, Chick-fil-A, Church's Chicken, KFC, Popeyes, Zaxby's and Culver's.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Chicken tenders were first made at the Puritan Backroom in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1974. Charlie Pappas salvaged chicken pieces that had been trimmed from larger cuts of chicken, marinating and frying them to create chicken tenders.<br/><br/>Other restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, have challenged this claim with later assertions to the invention of chicken tenders, although the consensus supports the claim in Manchester. In 2023, Manchester was officially declared the "Chicken Tender Capital of the World" by Mayor Joyce Craig.
