            Kennedy Fried Chicken and Crown Fried Chicken are common restaurant names primarily in the New York–New Jersey, Philadelphia, Delaware and Baltimore areas of the United States, but also in nearby smaller cities or towns along the Northeastern United States. Kennedy Fried Chickens typically compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in low income neighborhoods of several states along the East Coast. There are also a number in the West Coast, primarily in California.  A number of these restaurants, located in other states, are named New York Fried Chicken, essentially designed in the same manner and offering the same general menu as Kennedy and Crown Fried Chicken. It is not an actual franchise in the typical manner; every "Kennedy" named chicken restaurant is independently owned and operated by different individuals but consist of essentially the same menu.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Kennedy Fried Chicken was founded on May 16, 1969, with its first restaurant on Nostrand Avenue in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. There is a dispute among the people involved in the business over who is the actual founder. Some claim that it is Abdul Karim while others say Taeb Zia was the early founder. Zia, an Afghan immigrant originally from Kabul, Afghanistan, is known by some as Zia Chicken or "Lau Chicken". After studying engineering in Baku, Azerbaijan (then a republic of the Soviet Union), he immigrated to the United States in 1977 and began working at a New York City fast food restaurant chain by the name of Kansas Fried Chicken, founded by African-American entrepreneur Horace Bullard.
