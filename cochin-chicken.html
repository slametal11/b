            The Cochin is a breed of large domestic chicken. It derives from large feather-legged chickens brought from China to Europe and North America in the 1840s and 1850s. It is reared principally for exhibition. It was formerly known as the Cochin-China.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Like the Brahma, the Cochin derives from very large feather-legged chickens brought from China to Europe and North America in the 1840s and 1850s. These were at first known as "Shanghai" birds, and later as "Cochin-Chinas".: 89  The large size and striking appearance of these birds contributed to a sudden large increase of interest in poultry-breeding in Western countries, sometimes described as "hen fever".<br/><br/>The Cochin was included in the first edition of the Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry, prepared by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier for the first Poultry Club of Great Britain in 1865. The colours described are buff, black, cinnamon, grouse, lemon, partridge, silver buff, silver cinnamon, and white.: 5–12  Bantam Cochins were not listed.: 4 <br/><br/>The Cochin, both full-sized and bantam, was included in the first edition of the Standard of Excellence of the American Poultry Association in 1874. The original colours were white, partridge, buff and black; other colours were later added.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Characteristics ==<br/><br/>The most distinctive feature of the Cochin is the excessive plumage that covers leg and foot.
