            The Dominique is an American breed of chicken, characterized by black-and-white barred plumage and a rose comb. It is considered to be the oldest American chicken breed,: 121  and is thought to derive from birds brought to America by colonists from southern England. It was well known by about 1750, and by the mid-nineteenth century was widely distributed in the eastern United States.: 429 : 53  It is a dual-purpose breed, but is kept principally for its brown eggs.: 429  It became an endangered breed in the twentieth century, but numbers have since recovered.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The origins of the Dominique are unknown. It is considered to be the oldest American chicken breed,: 121  and is thought to derive from birds – probably similar to the modern Dorking or Sussex breeds – brought to America by colonists from southern England. Chickens with barred plumage, with either a single or a rose comb, were well known by about 1750, and by the mid-nineteenth century were widely distributed in the eastern United States.: 53 : 429  They were known by many names – among them Blue Spotted Hen, Dominic, Dominicker, Dominico, Old Grey Hen and Pilgrim Fowl – but were commonly known as Dominique. Some of the earliest books on poultry include these as a valuable American breed.: 97  Some were exhibited at the first American poultry show, held in Boston in 1849.: 429 <br/><br/>In the 1860s the Plymouth Rock was created by cross-breeding Black Java with large single-combed Dominiques; it was first exhibited in 1869. It was rather larger than the Dominique, but otherwise fairly similar. At a poultry show in New York in 1870, the organisers ruled that only rose-combed barred birds could be exhibited as Dominiques; those with single combs were to be entered as Plymouth Rocks.: 429  In 1871 this ruling was confirmed in a Standard of Excellence for the Dominique.: 429  In 1874 the Dominique was included in the first edition of the American Standard of Perfection of the new American Poultry Association; the Dominique bantam was added in 1960.: 6 <br/><br/>Breed numbers declined during the twentieth century, and by the 1970s the Dominique was close to disappearing. A recovery initiative was launched, and from 1983 numbers began to rise again.
