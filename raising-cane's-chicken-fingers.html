            Raising Cane's Restaurants, LLC, doing business as Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers (commonly referred to as Raising Cane's or Cane's) is an American fast casual chain specializing in chicken fingers founded in 1996 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by Todd Graves and Craig Silvey. The company is named after Graves's dog, a yellow Labrador. Other yellow Labradors have served as company mascots, as well as certified therapy animals.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Founders Todd Graves and Craig Silvey were studying at different universities when they wrote a plan for a chicken-finger restaurant which Silvey submitted in a business plan-writing course, receiving a C-minus grade. At the time, Graves worked at Guthrie's Chicken Fingers. <br/><br/>The business plan was rejected numerous times by potential investors, so Graves and Silvey earned the needed money working various manual labor jobs. They obtained an SBA loan, which they used to open their first restaurant, located in Baton Rouge at the intersection of Highland Road and State Street near the LSU campus. Silvey sold his share of the partnership shortly after the second restaurant opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In March 2020, many of Cane's locations switched from dine-in to pick-up and take-out service only due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas others closed temporarily. As of July 2020, certain locations had reopened their dining rooms, although Graves said the company was in no rush to do so on the full scale.
