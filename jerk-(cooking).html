            Jerk is a style of cooking native to Jamaica, in which meat is dry-rubbed or wet-marinated with a hot spice mixture called Jamaican jerk spice.<br/><br/>The technique of jerking (or cooking with jerk spice) originated from Jamaica's indigenous peoples, the Arawak and Taíno tribes, and was adopted by the descendants of 17th-century Jamaican Maroons who intermingled with them.<br/><br/>The smoky taste of jerked meat is achieved by using various cooking methods, including modern wood-burning ovens. Chicken or pork is usually jerked, and the main ingredients of the spicy jerk marinade / sauce are allspice and scotch bonnet peppers, which are native to Jamaica. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The word "jerk" is said to come from charqui, a Spanish term of Quechua origin for jerked or dried meat, which eventually became the word "jerky" in English.<br/><br/>The term jerk spice (also known as Jamaican jerk spice) refers to a spice rub. The word "jerk" refers to the spice rub, a wet marinade and mop sauce made from it, and to the particular cooking technique.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to evidence from historians, jerked meat was first cooked by the indigenous Taínos. During the invasion of Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists freed their enslaved Africans who fled into the Jamaican countryside, intermingling with the remaining Taínos, learning and adapting aspects of their culture— thus, becoming some of the first Jamaican Maroons. It appears that these runaway slaves learned this practice from the Taínos.
