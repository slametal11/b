            Yogi Bear's Honey Fried Chicken is an American fast food restaurant, formerly a restaurant chain, developed in 1968 and operating multiple locations into the 1970s. The chain sought to capitalize on the popularity of the cartoon character Yogi Bear, and the growing market for fast food fried chicken spawned by the success of Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origin and development ==<br/><br/>In the late 1960s, South Carolina restaurant entrepreneur Eugene Broome developed a honey-flavored chicken tenderizer, which became locally popular, leading Broome to open several restaurants. Broome initially wanted to name the restaurant after actor Jackie Gleason, with the intent of competing with Minnie Pearl's Fried Chicken, but Gleason declined the offer. Nonetheless, when the theme was changed, Broome retained as a motto one of Gleason's catchphrases from the TV series The Honeymooners, "How sweet it is!" After Gleason's rejection, Broome happened to see Yogi Bear on television, and contacted Hanna Barbera merchandising supervisor Ed Justin, who was willing to license the character, which led to the branding of the chain as Yogi Bear's Honey Fried Chicken. Coincidentally, the character of Yogi Bear was said to have been inspired by the character of Gleeson's costar on The Honeymooners, Art Carney's Ed Norton.<br/><br/>In January 1968, the Hardee's restaurant company paid $1 million to form a partnership with Broome for the licensing and operation of the chain. Despite having purchased the chain, "the branded stores were largely neglected" by Hardee's. By 1971, one magazine noted that "[w]hile hamburgers go fast, the company has had less success with a fried chicken entry. In fact, the Yogi Bear Honey Fried Chicken outlets (there are eleven now in the Southeast and Midwest) have been a bomb since the start in early 1968".
