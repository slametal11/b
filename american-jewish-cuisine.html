            American Jewish cuisine comprises the food, cooking, and dining customs associated with American Jews. It was heavily influenced by the cuisine of Jewish immigrants who came to the United States from Eastern Europe around the turn of the 20th century. It was further developed in unique ways by the immigrants and their descendants, especially in New York City and other large metropolitan areas of the northeastern U.S.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Between 1881 and 1921, around 2.5 million Jews immigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe.  Most of them settled in large cities in the northeastern part of the country, especially New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Baltimore. These immigrants brought with them a well-developed culinary heritage.  The cuisine continued to evolve in America, in the homes of the immigrants and their descendants, and in delicatessens and appetizing stores in New York City and elsewhere.<br/><br/>Delicatessens were quite popular among second-generation American Jews, especially in the mid-twentieth century.  They provided a place for the patrons to socialize in a comfortable environment.  They also popularized some of the dishes now associated with American Jewish cuisine, which were affordable for their upwardly mobile customers, but which would have seemed luxurious to their European ancestors.  Though not as numerous as they once were, delicatessens continue to be popular dining destinations.
