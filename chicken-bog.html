            Chicken bog is a pilaf dish made of rice and chicken, onion, spices, and sausage.  Chicken bog is most popular in Horry County - the home of Myrtle Beach and Conway - and west to Florence. It is very much a South Carolina thing and you are likely to get blank stares from folks in surrounding states when you mention it. Chicken Bog is prepared by boiling a whole chicken until tender (with the sausage, onion, and spices, if included), then the rice is added and cooked until it absorbs all the liquid. Cooks often pick the bones and other inedible parts out of the pot and discard them before adding the rice to the meat and other ingredients. There are some recipes out there that include green peppers and other vegetables, but the purists insist that the only ingredients should be chicken, smoked sausage, rice, salt and pepper and perhaps onion. <br/><br/>Loris, South Carolina is the chicken bog capital of the world where they salute this favorite dish at the "Loris Bog-Off".  Chicken bog is made different ways in different places, but it is perhaps found most often in the Pee Dee and Lowcountry regions of South Carolina.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origin of name ==<br/><br/>The name "bog" most likely comes from the wetness of the dish, but it has been speculated that the names came from the bogginess of the area in which it is popular. It is closely related to chicken pilau (or pilaf or perlo), except that it is more "boggy".
