            The Brown's Chicken massacre was a mass murder that occurred on January 8, 1993, in Palatine, Illinois, when two robbers shot and killed seven employees at a Brown's Chicken fast-food restaurant.<br/><br/>The case remained unsolved for nearly nine years, until one of the assailants was implicated by his girlfriend in 2002. Police used DNA samples from the murder scene to match one of the suspects, Juan Luna. Luna was put on trial in 2007, found guilty of seven counts of first degree murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. James Degorski, the other assailant, was found guilty in 2009 on all seven counts of first degree murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Incident ==<br/><br/>On January 8, 1993, seven people were shot and killed at the Brown's Chicken &amp; Pasta at 168 West Northwest Highway in Palatine. The victims included the owners, 50-year-old Richard E. Ehlenfeldt and 49-year-old Lynn A. Ehlenfeldt (née Wiese), and five employees: 46-year-old Guadalupe Maldonado, 16-year-old Michael C. Castro, 17-year-old Rico L. Solis, 32-year-old Thomas Mennes, and 31-year-old Marcus Nellsen; Castro and Solis were Palatine High School students working there part-time. All victims had been killed in two walk-in freezers. Lynn Ehlenfeldt also had her throat slashed before being shot. The assailants stole between $1,800 and $1,900 from the restaurant, equivalent to $4,027 in 2024.
