            Foosackly's (stylized as foosackly's) is an American chain of chicken restaurants in coastal Alabama and Northwest Florida.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Foosackly's was co-founded by Will Fusaiotti and Eric Brechtel. The two attended Louisiana State University together. Fusaiotti moved to Mobile with his family in 1995 to help his father open a Smoothie King. Fusaiotti and Brechtel had never fried a piece of chicken until the weekend before opening their first location on University Boulevard in Mobile in 2000. The first location opened on April 28, 2000.<br/><br/>The restaurant has grown into a mini-chain in Alabama with 14 current operating locations in Mobile, Daphne, Foley, Saraland, Semmes, Auburn, and two in Pensacola, Florida. The chain opened its fourteenth location, in Tuscaloosa, in 2020, and has plans to open further locations in Baldwin County and in Pensacola. Fusaiotti has also considered opening restaurants in downtown Mobile, Spanish Fort, and locations northward toward Montgomery and Birmingham, describing his philosophy of "It's not how many you open, it's how many you keep open."<br/><br/>All restaurants had to shut down their in-room dine-ins in mid-March 2020 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers could still make their orders via drive-thru, take-away or pick-up service.
