            Subway IP LLC, trading as Subway, is an American multinational fast food restaurant franchise that specializes in submarine sandwiches (subs) and wraps. It was founded by Fred DeLuca and financed by Peter Buck in 1965 as Pete's Super Submarine Sandwiches in Bridgeport, Connecticut. After several name changes, it was renamed Subway in 1972, and a franchise operation began in 1974 with a second restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut.<br/><br/>It was the fastest-growing franchise in the world in 2015 and, as of September 2023, has over 37,000 locations in more than 102 countries and territories. More than half its locations (21,796 or 61.1%) are in the United States. It is the largest single-brand restaurant chain and the largest restaurant operator in the world. Its international headquarters are in Shelton, Connecticut.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Foundation and early years ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1965, Fred DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from his friend Peter Buck to start "Pete's Drive-In: Super Submarine Sandwiches" at 3851 Main Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and in the following year, they formed Doctor's Associates Inc. to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded. The holding company derives its name from DeLuca's goal to earn enough from the business to pay tuition for medical school, as well as Buck's having a doctorate in physics.
