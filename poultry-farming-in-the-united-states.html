            Poultry farming is a part of the United States's agricultural economy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the United States, chickens were raised primarily on family farms or in some cases, in poultry colonies, such as Judge Emery's Poultry Colony until about 1960. Originally, the primary value in poultry keeping was eggs, and meat was considered a byproduct of egg production. A United States Department of the Interior census in 1840 found American farmers had a total combined poultry flock valued at approximately $12 million ($378 million in today's dollars).<br/><br/>Following the Treaty of Wanghia between the US and China in 1844, oriental poultry breeds were imported to New England, and Rhode Island became the nation's first major poultry center. Cross-breeding between English and Asian birds created new breeds still common today, like the Barred Plymouth Rock. Chickens remained primarily to provide eggs, mostly to the farmer (subsistence agriculture), with commercialization still largely unexplored. Farm flocks tended to be small because the hens largely fed themselves through foraging, with some supplementation of grain, scraps, and waste products from other farm ventures. Such feedstuffs were in limited supply, especially in the winter, and this tended to regulate the size of the farm flocks. Soon after poultry keeping gained the attention of agricultural researchers (around 1896), improvements in nutrition and management made poultry keeping more profitable and businesslike.
