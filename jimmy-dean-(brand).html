            Jimmy Dean Foods  is an American brand of meat products marketed and owned by Tyson Foods. The company was founded in 1969 by country singer and actor Jimmy Dean. It was purchased by Sara Lee, which then divested as part of a unit known as Hillshire Brands, which was later purchased by Tyson Foods.<br/><br/>Jimmy Dean's main products are chicken and pork sausage based breakfast items. The brand is known to have quick and simple meals that are easily cooked and microwavable. Jimmy Dean products can be sold raw, frozen, precooked, assembled, or individually wrapped.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Dean founded the Jimmy Dean Sausage brand of breakfast sausage, which was originally called "Pure Pork Sausage." The Jimmy Dean Sausage company did well, in part due to Dean's own extemporized, good-humored commercials. In 1980, the first Jimmy Dean Restaurant opened in northwest Columbus, Ohio, followed by another in west Columbus the following year. Jimmy Dean opened three more restaurants in the Columbus Square shopping center, Oklahoma City, and Indianapolis in 1983.<br/><br/>Dean sold the company to the Sara Lee Corporation in 1984 for $80 million.
